# Topics to cover for the docker lunch and learn. Will turn into a micro quest on CloudAssessments.com for learning
I'd love to hear thoughts for the Docker lunch and learn. Immediatly my goal will probably be to Dockerize a basic rails application
which uses sidekiq and MariaDB.

# Lunch and learn agenda
* A brief history of containers
* Everything you need to know to make your boss love you // Containers have a business use case that even CEO's would love.
* Containers, but what about serverless?!?!?!?! 
* Why developers should love containers
* Link to the github repo for the demo rails app
* Building and running our first container
* Step backwards: Build a Dockerfile for the rails app
* Tagging
* Introducing docker compose and services (sidecar container concept)
* docker-compose.yml // Mariadb
* docker-compose.yml // redshift
* docker-compose rails
* Walk through of the app and connectivity information // Will be default but we will want to show/teach everyone how to connect to the services 
using the proper environment variables
* Docker in production
** swarm
** kubernetes
** ecs 
** service communication and service discovery
** CI / CD piplines
** Container security (tease)
