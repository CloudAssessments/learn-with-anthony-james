# About quests 
Quests are designed as replacements of courses on cloudassessments.com. The goal is to build more of a journey and story telling experience.

Quest story line proposal: April has started working for a startup that has a monolithic application currently running on vm's. She has been assigned the challenge of helping the organization increase the speed of code production, reduce the cost of scaling, and become more agile. After recently learning about containers she decides to peruse this solution and modify the instaflam's application to work in a service oriented architectures running on containers. Immediately before worrying about running containers in production she jumps in to setup the code set on using docker containers for her developers. She knows that this will help increase development time and reduce setup issues for developers working on the project.

# Course/Quest Name: Learn Docker With Anthony James
* About this course // Want to cover the depth of the quest/course and what we hope to accomplish and why it matters to your development and how it solves caling and business problems
* About Anthony James // Only if you want
* What we will accomplish in this quest // Will show the working application, that we will be building through the quest and then work backwards

* History of containers

# Acitivity 1: Getting Started With Docker
* History of containers // Quick run down of the history of containers (I'm worried this is to boring, thoughts?)
* Micro services, containers, and vm's o' my! // Describe what problems containers solve and how the solve them.
* Connecting to docker hub
* Running docker images // We will pull a docker image with our demo app from a public repo and run it. Goal is to get into "doing stuff" first and then back into building it from scratch
* Understanding Docker caching // We'll make a change to our docker file and look at docker "layering"
* Artechecture accomplishment overview // Now that you are running your first application lets talk about how it works and why
Challenge Activity: Will present the student with a vm, the challenge will be to get docker setup and running and pull down the application from the public docker repository.



# Activity N: This is the last activity it will be designed at introducing advanced concepts and will also be used as the first activity of the container deep dive quest.
