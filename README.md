# Proposal Summary for "Learn with Anthony" First Track 

Based upon feedback from the [community discussion](https://linuxacademy.com/community/posts/show/topic/20032-community-can-you-help-me-anthony) and [LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12059299), it looks like we are going to be focusing on Docker containers. My plan is to do content on Docker, Kubernetes, and ECS, then take it step farther with exploring deployment pipelines for CI/CD for each topic. We already have a demo app to use with unit tests that our dev team built (GitHub link impending).

# How the Open Source Course Syllabus Building Process Works 

Each course/quest will share a title with a file in this repo. The file will include the syllabus and what is being covered in the course or quest. If you would like to make suggestions, create a pull request or [issue](https://github.com/CloudAssessments/learn-with-anthony-james/issues). I'll involve you in the video process to review the content before it ever goes out. All videos will be open source. 

# Proposal for Tools to be Covered in Their Own Course/Quest

* Docker
* Prometheus (monitoring)
* Weave (service discovery)
* Kubernetes (container orchestration)
* Swarm (container orchestration, alternative to Kubernetes)
* ECS
* Container security
* CI/Cd pipeline (AWS or Jenkins, TBD)

# Stretch Goals for "Learn with Anthony James"

* Azure Service Fabric (Kubernetes on Azure)
* Google Cloud Container Service (Kubernetes on GCP)
* CoreOS
* Elasticsearch with Containers (because why not?)
