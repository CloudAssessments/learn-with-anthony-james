#Proposal summary for learn with Anthony first track 
From the community discussion it looks like we are going to be focusing on Docker containers. My plan is to do content on Docker, Kubernetes, ECS, and then take it step farther with deployment pipelines for CI/CD to each of those. We already have a demo app to use with unit tests our dev team built (I'll link to github when I can, on a flight at this time).

#How the open source course syllabus building process works. 
Each course/quest will have a title of a file in the repo. The file will denote what the syllabus is and what is covered. If you would like to make suggestions to it create a pull request or post in issues. I'll involve you in the video process for review before it ever goes out. All the videos will be open source. 

#Proposal for tools to be covered individually in their own course/quest
*Docker
*Prometheus (Monitoring)
*Weave  (service discovery)
*Kubernetes (container orchestration)
*Swarm (container orchestration as an alternative to Kubernetes)
*ECS
*Container security
*CI/Cd pipeline, not sure if this will be AWS or a jenkins build process. 

#Stretch goals for learn with Anthony James
*Azure service fabric (kubernetes on azure)
*Google cloud container service (Kubernetes on google)
*CoreOS
*Elastic Search with containers (because why not?)
